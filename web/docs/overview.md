# Overview

_ixtable is a desktop app that stores a small business application as one portable `.ixt` file._

You design the application in **Studio** and run it in the **Runtime**. Both are part of the same desktop app on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and neither needs an account. The `.ixt` file holds the tables, records, queries, forms, reports, dashboards, actions, and assets together.

## The project file

An `.ixt` file is a SQLite database with a fixed set of archive tables. While a project is open, ixtable works on an extracted copy and saves it back into the file. Saves write a new file beside the old one, check it, and then replace the old one. A crash or a full disk leaves the last good save in place.

ixtable autosaves a titled project a moment after each change. The save status shows when the project has unsaved changes, is saving, is saved, or failed to save. After a crash, the start screen offers to recover the unsaved work.

## Modes

Studio groups its tools into modes. Switch modes with the mode buttons in the sidebar.

| Mode | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [Data](./concepts/data-view) | Create tables, design columns and relationships, and edit records in a grid |
| Query | Write SQL or build a query visually, add parameters, and save it |
| [Design](./concepts/design-view) | Build forms on a resizable grid with validation and computed fields |
| Reports | Lay out printable reports with groups and totals, then print or save a PDF |
| Dashboards | Arrange charts, numbers, forms, and reports on the same grid that forms use |
| Automation | Define actions and record triggers, and watch background jobs |
| Settings | Manage assets, the datasource, roles, migrations, releases, and logs |
| Runtime | Run the application the way its users will see it |

## Where records live

Records live in an embedded SQLite database inside the project file, or in a PostgreSQL database you connect in Settings. ixtable writes each change straight to that database. Every list, form, query, report, and dashboard then reads through DuckDB, so a change is visible to the next read. PostgreSQL hosting and backups stay your responsibility.

## Sharing an application

You can share an application two ways. Send the `.ixt` file to give someone an editable copy. Export a runtime-only bundle from Settings to give someone an application they can run but not edit. [Deployment](./concepts/deployment) covers bundles.

## Generated screenshots

The images in these docs come from `scripts/screenshot/specs/app-shell.spec.tsx`. The test renders the app, performs user actions, and captures the resulting app state with Playwright.

Regenerate the documentation images from the repository root:

```shell
npm run screenshot
```

The command tests the captured states before it copies selected images beside the documentation in `web/docs/assets`. Docusaurus fingerprints these relative assets when it builds the site.
