# Deployment

_Deploy an ixtable application by exporting a signed runtime-only bundle and sending it to the people who use it._

A **runtime-only bundle** is an `.ixtr` file that holds a complete application. Recipients open it in ixtable and can run the application but not edit its design. You distribute the file yourself, by email or a shared drive. To distribute privately with automatic updates instead, see [ixtable Cloud](../cloud/getting-started).

## Export a bundle

Open Settings, then the Release tab. Enter a version such as `1.2.0`, release notes, and an optional minimum Runtime version, then choose **Export runtime bundle…**. ixtable signs every bundle with a key it creates on your computer the first time you export. After an export, the Release tab shows the signer fingerprint. Send it to recipients over a channel they trust.

You can also protect the bundle with a password. A password protects the bundle at rest and against casual unauthorized opening. It does not stop an authorized recipient from extracting the data the application shows them, or any credentials the application can reach.

## Open and update a bundle

Recipients choose **Open runtime bundle…** on the start screen. ixtable checks the signature before it reads anything else, so a changed or damaged file does not open. The first bundle for an application also pins your signing key. A later bundle for that application signed by any other key is refused.

Each recipient keeps their own records. The bundle's records seed the installation on first open only. To install a new version, the recipient chooses **Check for update…** and picks the new file. ixtable applies the new design and its migrations to a copy of the recipient's records. It switches to that copy only after every migration and health check passes. A failed update leaves the previous version running. Installing an older version requires an explicit confirmation. [Runtime bundles](../guides/runtime-bundles) covers each step.

## Databases

An application that uses the embedded SQLite database gives every recipient a separate copy of the records. An application that uses PostgreSQL connects each recipient to the database you configured. The bundle never contains the PostgreSQL password. The project file only stores a reference to a password saved on your computer.
