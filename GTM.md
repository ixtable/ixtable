# ixtable go-to-market inventory

Status of everything ixtable needs to reach paying customers, and who does
each item. It complements `PRD.md`: the PRD defines the product and its
launch gates, this file tracks the work around it.

Status is Done, Partial, or Missing. Owner is one of:

- You: needs an account, money, a legal decision, or your judgment.
- Claude: code or content Claude can write in these repos.
- Both: Claude prepares it, you approve it or supply a value.

## Decisions already made

- Business model: free Apache-2.0 desktop app, paid ixtable Cloud priced
  per cloud application with a runtime-user allowance (PRD §4).
- Privacy: the desktop app and Cloud send no third-party analytics.
  Activation is measured only from Cloud sign-ups, as daily aggregate counts.
  GA4 runs on the marketing website only (PRD §27.5, §30).
- Payments: Stripe direct with Stripe Tax.
- Draft pricing: US$19 per cloud application per month with 5 runtime
  users, US$4 per extra runtime user, annual billing gets 2 months free.
  Shown as planned pricing until validated.
- Website CTAs: waitlist (primary), GitHub, download marked "coming soon"
  until signed installers exist.
- Measurement: biz-tools collects daily aggregates into its repo, writes a
  monthly report, and opens `gtm-alert` issues in biz-tools.

## Inventory

### 1. Positioning and messaging

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ideal customer profile | Partial | You | PRD §3.1 names technical operations teams. No list of target industries, team sizes, or the spreadsheets/Access databases they replace. |
| Positioning statement | Missing | Both | One sentence against Access, Airtable, NocoDB, and Retool. Strongest wedge: Access does not run on macOS or Linux; ixtable does, and works offline. |
| Landing page copy | Partial | Claude | Hero and features exist. Needs the positioning statement and proof (screenshots of a golden app). |
| Comparison pages | Missing | Claude | "Microsoft Access alternative", "Access for Mac", "ixtable vs NocoDB / Baserow / Budibase / Retool". The monthly competitor-gap report feeds these. |
| Customer interviews | Missing | You | 10 to 15 conversations with target users to validate the positioning and the price. |

### 2. Pricing and packaging

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pricing page | Partial | Claude | Live with draft numbers and the PRD §4.4 comparison table. |
| Price validation | Missing | You | Test US$19 per app with interviews or a waitlist survey before launch. |
| Over-allowance behaviour | Missing | You | What happens at runtime user 6: block the invite, bill the overage, or prompt to upgrade. |
| Trial | Missing | You | Free trial length, or a free first cloud app. |
| Discounts | Missing | You | Education, non-profit, and open-source contributor policy. |

### 3. Product readiness (PRD launch gates)

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRD Phases 0 to 5 | Partial | Both | Phase 5 (§28) is the commercial gate. Track it separately from this file. |
| Signed macOS installer | Missing | You | Apple Developer Program (US$99/year), Developer ID certificate, notarization credentials in CI. |
| Signed Windows installer | Missing | You | Code-signing certificate, or Azure Trusted Signing. |
| Linux packages | Missing | Claude | AppImage and .deb from Tauri, published to GitHub Releases. |
| Auto-update channel | Missing | Both | Tauri updater signing key (you generate and store it), update feed (I wire it). |
| Onboarding with golden apps | Missing | Claude | PRD §26: CRM, inventory, work orders as first-run templates. |
| Opt-in crash reports | Missing | Claude | PRD §27.5 requires informed consent. Self-hosted endpoint or a provider you choose. |
| Docs accuracy | Partial | Claude | `docs/concepts/deployment.md` says deployment is undefined; it should describe PRD §21 to §23 as planned. |

### 4. Website (ixtable.com)

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain and canonical URLs | Done | Claude | Sitemap, canonical links, and `robots.txt` use ixtable.com with trailing-slash URLs. |
| Redirect from ixtable.pages.dev | Missing | You | Cloudflare redirect rule, 301 to ixtable.com. |
| GA4 | Partial | You | Code is in place; set the `GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` repository variable. |
| Cookie consent for GA4 | Missing | Both | GA4 needs consent for EU and UK visitors. Pick a consent tool or use Google Consent Mode v2 with a banner; I wire it. |
| Waitlist | Partial | You | Form and table exist. Needs a hosted Supabase project to receive sign-ups. |
| Pricing page | Done | Claude | Draft numbers, labelled as planned. |
| Blog | Done | Claude | Enabled with a first post; weekly drafts arrive as PRs. |
| Legal pages | Missing | Both | Terms, privacy policy, cookie policy, subprocessors list. |
| Security page | Missing | Both | PRD Phase 5 requires security documentation and the trusted-user threat model. |
| Changelog and roadmap | Missing | Claude | Public changelog from releases; roadmap from PRD phases. |
| Status page | Missing | You | Hosted status page for Cloud once it exists. |

### 5. Accounts and email

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hosted Supabase project | Missing | You | Create it, apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations`, set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for the site build. |
| Auth URLs | Missing | You | Set `site_url` and redirect URLs to ixtable.com in the hosted project. |
| Custom SMTP | Missing | You | Supabase's built-in email is rate-limited and not meant for production. Use Resend or Postmark with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC on ixtable.com. |
| Google and Microsoft sign-in | Missing | You | PRD §21.1 requires both. The local config has GitHub and Google placeholders; Microsoft (Azure) needs adding. |
| Email domain | Missing | You | support@, security@, and hello@ixtable.com mailboxes. |
| Waitlist launch email | Missing | Both | A sending tool with unsubscribe handling. I can build a send script on the email provider's API. |

### 6. Billing

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stripe account | Missing | You | Create it, verify the business, enable Stripe Tax and register where required. |
| Products and prices | Missing | Both | One product per plan; prices in USD. I can script creation once the account exists. |
| Checkout and customer portal | Missing | Claude | PRD Phase 5. |
| Webhooks to entitlements | Missing | Claude | Stripe events update a Cloud entitlements table. |
| `gtm_entitlements()` RPC | Missing | Claude | Returns `(subscription_id, state)` for the daily billing reconciliation in biz-tools. |
| Dunning and refunds | Missing | You | Retry schedule, failed-payment emails, refund policy. |
| Restricted Stripe key for biz-tools | Missing | You | Read-only key in the `commerce-production` environment; then set `commerce.stripe.enabled: true`. |

### 7. Legal and company

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legal entity | Missing | You | Needed for Stripe, Apple, and contracts. |
| Terms of service | Missing | Both | I draft from the PRD's trusted-user model; a lawyer reviews. |
| Privacy policy | Missing | Both | Must say the desktop app collects nothing, what Cloud stores, and that the website uses GA4. |
| Data processing agreement | Missing | Both | Business customers will ask for one. |
| Subprocessors list | Missing | Claude | Supabase, Stripe, Cloudflare, Google Analytics, the email provider, S3. |
| Trademark | Missing | You | Search and register "ixtable". Apache-2.0 does not grant trademark rights, so a trademark policy stops forks using the name. |
| Contributor terms | Missing | Both | DCO sign-off or a CLA before accepting outside code. |
| `SECURITY.md` and disclosure address | Missing | Claude | Plus the independent security review PRD §21.3 requires before launch (you commission it). |

### 8. Measurement (biz-tools)

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Collectors and monthly report | Done | Claude | GA4, Search Console, Bing, GitHub, Cloud funnel, Stripe subscriptions, entitlements. |

| Experiments | Missing | Both | Log one each time a change ships to the funnel. |

### 9. Channels and launch

| Item | Status | Owner | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public GitHub repository | Missing | You | The repo is private. For an Apache-2.0 product, the public repo is a primary channel. Make it public once the README and license are ready. |
| Repository README | Partial | Claude | Needs screenshots, a short demo GIF, and install steps once installers exist. |
| Search content | Partial | Both | Weekly draft PRs from keyword and competitor data; you edit and merge. |
| Directories | Missing | Both | AlternativeTo (as a Microsoft Access alternative), awesome-tauri, open-source alternative lists. I draft listings; you submit. |
| Communities | Missing | You | r/MSAccess, r/selfhosted, r/sysadmin, Hacker News (Show HN), Product Hunt, Indie Hackers. Post when installers are signed. |
